=head1 NAME

RT::Action::SLA_SetDefault - set default SLA value

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sets a default level of service. Transaction's created field is used
to calculate if things happen in hours or out of. Default value then
figured from L<InHoursDefault|XXX> and L<OutOfHoursDefault|XXX> options.

This action doesn't check if the ticket has a value already, so you
have to use it with condition that checks this fact for you, however
such behaviour allows you to force setting up default using custom
condition. The default condition for this action is
L<RT::Condition::SLA_RequireDefault>.
